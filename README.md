# MIPS-compiler

I created a compiler for a low level assembly language that I used in one of my assignments, it is based in the MIPS Arquitecture. 

I explained the project in my [blog.](https://unzurdo.github.io/blog/Simple-Lexer-and-Parser-in-GO/)
The demo it's available as a webapp written in Go and hosted in [heroku](https://mips-compiler.herokuapp.com/)
